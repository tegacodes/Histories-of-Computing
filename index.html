			<h2>Description:</h2>
			This course explores how historical and cultural knowledge can be enriched through hands-on technological practice, and deepens an aesthetic exploration of digital media through greater awareness of the historical materiality of computer
			technology. The course will alternate between seminars offering historical analysis, lecture and discussion of aspects of computer history, and labs offering technical instruction and hands on experimentation with some of these tools and
			technologies. Meeting once per week, this course’s readings and activities move students from the innermost workings of the computer through to the implications of its outermost cultural forms and materiality, with a historical focus on the
			computer’s development from the mid-1970s to the late-1980s.
